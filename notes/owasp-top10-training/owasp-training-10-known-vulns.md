## Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

The range of impact is pretty variable:

- the component could have any kind of vulnerability


This can turn into large software maintainability project

- don't let it go for too long
- be aware of what you're protecting against
- treat it like technical debt

Know when you want/are going to update these components

At the very least, be able to view if something is out of date
