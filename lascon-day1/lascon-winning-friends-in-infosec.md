- How to connect better with your manager/management?

Book recommendation: How to Win Fridns and Influence People by Dale Carnegie

Critcism immediately puts people on the defensive

- it's how you say, not what you say

Hard hats

- people weren't wearing the hard hats on a jobsite
- first, ask what the problem is
	- are they uncomfortable
	- do they do something else?
- then explain the inherent safety concern of wearing a hard hat

If you would like to change, regulate, improve...why not start with yourself?


You have to cater to what people want

- literally take a look at Maslow's hierarchy

How well do you think people will perform under a spirit of approval rather than criticism?

- when was the last time you asked for a customer rep's manager to tell them how good the rep did?


"He who can do this has the whole world with Him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."

When you're fishing for people

- will you put your favorite food on the line, or theirs?


In infosec, you're a salesperson

- sell on why to fix a vuln
- why to hire someone
- why to buy a tool/tech

Tips

- fulfil the immediate need
- show appreciation
- communicate how you're working to help them, and their needs

Holiday card story

- Josh received a card, it was simple, but mailed and handwritten
- it meant so much because it stood out to Josh that card took thought and intent from that friend

Chinese proverb - "a man without smile must not open a shop"

How to Convince Others

- 9 out of 10, you will not win an argument
	- both sides will go away angry or resentful
	- "A man convinced of his will is of the same opinion still."

- Listen first
- Control your temper, avoid defensiveness
- Be willing to admit you're wrong
	- this may even drive others to be open to admitting they're wrong
	- and thus, find common ground
- Keep emphasizing the things you agree on
	- a "no" response is the hardest handicap to overcome
	- get "yes" from the other, and move in the affirmative direction: Socratic method

How to get Cooperation

- don't you have more faith in your own ideas than those from others?
- sacrifice credit for results
- *make it their idea*
