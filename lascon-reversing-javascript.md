## Reversing JavaScript Frameworks

You can use gorp to modify web responses

Gorp has runtime debuggers now

- XHR breakpoints
- allow you to inject custom code for dynamic manipulation of application variables and functions

DharmaOfCode/gorp on github.com

- he's trying to keep up with documentation
- so likely a PR would be appreciated on that front

Forcing Dev Mode

- configure gorp config file
- write some custom code to handle what gorp will dump?
- browse to target site?

Don't do this for every application

- works well when you have a lot of time on the project

Use the inspector (in gorp) to record API endpoints used

Use the injector plugin (in gorp) to replace functions
