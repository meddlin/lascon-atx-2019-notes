## Unvalidated Redirects

Application redirects to an unvalidated page/redirect; it's an unsafe forward

Consider the business value of your users' trust

- these forwards going wrong can violate that trust


'url' parameters in the query string is a red flag


Redirects use everything in the URL

- the SSL
- the pre-defined piece of the URL
- it looks really nice when a site is already trusted
- things get complex when you include things like bit.ly links
